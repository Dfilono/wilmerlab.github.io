The image depicts the overall approach of this work to optimize MOF array selection for methane-air gas mixtures.
A MOF based electronic nose is modeled via atomistic simulations. The results are used to gather information
regarding an unknown gas mixture to quantify the performance of various array configurations.

The [algorithm](https://github.com/JennaGustafson/sensor_array_mof_adsorption){:target="_blank"} presented in the paper acts as an efficient screening tool for MOF array selection.
