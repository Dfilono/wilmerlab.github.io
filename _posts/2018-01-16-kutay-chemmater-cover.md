Kutay's [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemmater.7b05015) on thermal transport properties
of interpenetrated Metal-Organic Frameworks was accepted as a cover article in Chemistry of Materials!

In the study it was found that interpenetration approximately doubles the thermal conductivity of a MOF.
This important in applications such as gas storage where high thermal conductivity of a porous material would
allow it to dissipate the heat generated by adsorption faster.

The image depicts an interpenetrated crystal structure using an incandescent metal like material to represent the increased thermal conductivity.
The image was rendered using Blender with Cycles engine and [this incandescent metal material from Blendswap](https://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/70363).


The study was also covered by Pitt engineering news [here](https://www.engineering.pitt.edu/News/2018/Wilmer-Lab-Journal-Cover/).
