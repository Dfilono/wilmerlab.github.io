*November 1st, 2019*

As a fellow of MolSSI, Kutay lead a two-day best software practices workshop at the University of Pittsburgh
on November 7th and 8th, 2019. The workshop, which reached capacity and even had a long waitlist, covered a variety of topics,
including Python code style and git basics. Thanks Kutay!
