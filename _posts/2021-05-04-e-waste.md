In a collaboration with [Callie
Babbitt](https://www.rit.edu/directory/cwbgis-callie-babbitt) and [Gregory
Babbitt](https://www.rit.edu/directory/gabsbi-gregory-babbitt) from the
Rochester Institute of Technology, Chris and Daniel studied fraud in the space
of [electronic waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_waste)
recycling.  This is our lab's first publication in the domain of environmental
engineering, and is one part of a larger program to study sustainability in the
context of [circular economies](https://circular-designs.org/).
