Their team, [Health-E-Nose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUC0e-4XCZ0&t=2s){:target="_blank"}, aims to
commercialize a breath sensor for disease diagnosis and the overall improvement of human performance. Joining them
are collaborators Dr. Paul Ohodnicki and Dr. Jagannath Devkota of the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL),
experimentalists with expertise in the design of gas sensor devices.

Wilmer and Gustafson will be pitching Health-E-Nose at the final round of [PInCh](http://www.pinch.pitt.edu/index.htm){:target="_blank"} on September 26th, for a top prize of $100,000.
