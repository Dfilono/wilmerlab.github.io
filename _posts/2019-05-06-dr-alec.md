Alec Kaija (now Dr. Alec Kaija) becomes the second WilmerLab PhD alumnus after successfully defending his thesis. Not surprisingly,
Alec accomplished many impressive things during his time as at the Wilmer Lab, including co-founding the oxygen storage company, Aeronics Inc.
Alec has now joined the RAND Corporation in Washington, D.C.

Congratulations Alec, and wishing you the best of luck!
