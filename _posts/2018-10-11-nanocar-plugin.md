Kutay made a molecular car builder plug-in for Avogadro 2 as part of his MolSSI fellowship project.
The plug-in is available in GitHub [here](https://github.com/kbsezginel/nanocar-avogadro).

Currently the main functionalities are:
- Adding a chassis molecule
- Connecting a wheel molecule
- Building a metal surface to place the Nanocar

This plug-in is a part of molecular CAD tool Kutay wants to develop to design artificial molecular machines.
Any feedback is appreciated!
