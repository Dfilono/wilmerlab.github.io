[Kutay](https://kbsezginel.github.io/)'s [paper](#publication) on interpenetrating Metal-Organic Frameworks was featured on the cover of CrystEngComm. The paper also got picked up by Chemistry World. [See the news article here](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/algorithm-deliberately-entangles-mofs/3007817.article){:target="_blank"}.

The cover art is a representation of interpenetrated crystal structures (MOFs).
The entangled molecular structures are depicted in blue-gray and red.

The algorithm presented in the paper identifies couples of crystal structures which can be entangled in 3 dimensions.
The molecular structures are quite complex and we like to explore how these entanglements affect physical properties.

The image depicts three entangled (interpenetrated) MOFs found by the [IPMOF](https://github.com/kbsezginel/ipmof){:target="_blank"} algorithm.
[18 novel hetero-interpenetrated MOFs](https://github.com/kbsezginel/IPMOF-candidates){:target="_blank"} were predicted by the algorithm and it would be exciting to see which ones could actually be synthesized.

Here is an animation showing one of the 18 hetero-interpenetrating frameworks:

Recently, the study was awarded the **Outstanding PhD Paper for Summer Term 2017** by Chemical & Petroleum Engineering
Department at the University of Pittsburgh.
