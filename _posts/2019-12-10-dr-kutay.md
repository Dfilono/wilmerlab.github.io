*December 10th, 2019*

Kutay Sezginel (now Dr. Kutay Sezginel) becomes the third WilmerLab PhD alumnus after successfully defending his thesis. Kutay accomplished many great things
during his time at the Wilmer Lab, including multiple publications, multiple covers, leading workshops on best software practices, and viral coverage of
experimental nanocar races, which resulted in him pioneering the use of computational chemistry tools for the design and evaluation of nanocars.
This culminated in the founding of the Formula Nano, a computational molecule car race intended to advance molecular design.

Congratulations Kutay, and best of luck in the future! You will be missed!
